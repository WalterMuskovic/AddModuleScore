From `?AddModuleScore` we get the following information:

Calculate the average expression levels of each program (cluster) on single cell level, subtracted by the aggregated expression of control feature sets. All analyzed features are binned based on averaged expression, and the control features are randomly selected from each bin.

In the source code the authors reference [Tirosh et al, Science, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aad0501). From the supplementary materials we get the following:

The  top 100  MITF-correlated  genes  across  the  entire  set  of  malignant  cells  were  defined as  the MITF  program,  and  their  average  relative  expression  as  the  MITF-program  cell  score.  The average expression of the top 100 genes that negatively correlate with the MITF program scores were defined as the AXL program and used to define AXL program cell score. To decrease the effect that the quality and complexity of each cellâ€™s data might have on its MITF/AXL scores we defined  control  gene-sets  and  their  average  relative  expression  as  control  scores,  for  both  the MITF  and  AXL  programs.  These  control  cell  scores  were  subtracted  from  the  respective MITF/AXL  cell  scores.  The  control  gene-sets  were  defined  by  first  binning  all  analyzed  genes into 25 bins of aggregate expression levels and then, for each  gene in the  MITF/AXL  gene-set, randomly selecting 100 genes from the same expression bin as that gene.  In this way,  a control gene-sets have a comparable distribution of expression levels to that of the MITF/AXL gene-set and  the  control  gene  set  is  100-fold  larger,  such  that  its  average  expression  is  analogous  to averaging over 100 randomly-selected gene-sets of the same size as the MITF/AXL gene-set. To calculate significance of  the changes in AXL  and MITF programs upon relapse, we defined the expression  log2-ratio  between  matched  pre- and  post- samples  for all  AXL  and  MITF  program genes  (Fig.  3D).  Since  AXL  and  MITF  programs  are  inversely  related,  we  flipped  the  signs  of the  log-ratios  for  MITF  program  genes  and  used  a  t-test to  examine  if  the  average  of  the combined  set  of  AXL  program  and  (sign-flipped)  MITF  program  genes  is  significantly  higher than zero, which was the case for four out of six matched sample pairs (Fig. 3D, black arrows).

The code for the function is here:

```{r}
library(Seurat)
AddModuleScore
```

```{r}
## Load library rlang - need for %||% to work 
library(rlang)

## Define two small functions called withing AddModuleScore
# Define small function to check the length of components of a list
LengthCheck <- function(values, cutoff = 0) {
  return(vapply(
    X = values,
    FUN = function(x) {
      return(length(x = x) > cutoff)
    },
    FUN.VALUE = logical(1)
  ))
}
# Call gc() to perform garbage collection
CheckGC <- function() {
  if (getOption(x = "Seurat.memsafe")) {
    gc(verbose = FALSE)
  }
}

## Define variables to input to the AddModuleScore function
object <- pbmc_small
features <- list(c('CD79B','CD79A','CD19','CD180','CD200','CD3D','CD2','CD3E','CD7','CD8A','CD14','CD1C','CD68','CD9','CD247'))
pool <- NULL
nbin <- 24
ctrl <- 5
k <-  FALSE
assay <- NULL
name <- "Cluster"
seed <- 1
search <- FALSE

## Now we can go through the inner workings of the function and inspect what happens at every step
# The first half of the code is checks and balances - small adjustments to the input variables and making sure they are of the expected form
# The second half of the code contains the actual operations performed by the function. I've heavily annotated the code explaining what each step does. I also inlcuded an explanatory plot, depicting how the genes are ranked and binned, and how the control genes are selected from those bins.

#myAddModuleScore <- function (object, features, pool = NULL, nbin = 24, ctrl = 100, k = FALSE, assay = NULL, name = "Cluster", seed = 1, search = FALSE) {
